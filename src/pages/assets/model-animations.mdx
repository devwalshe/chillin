# üèÉ Model Animations

Let's talk about controling model animations, which is a different topic from [üé¨ Animations & Transitions](/graphics/animations-transitions).

## Rigging

If you want a model to be animated, you first need to **rig** it, which means adding **bones** to it. Once a model is rigged, it will follow the bones' movements as you transform them. You can use Blender to rig a model:

[Mannequin.js](https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/)' [Posture Editor](https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/posture-editor.html) is a nice tool to familiarize yourself with manipulating human bones and joints.

## Animating

Animating is done by positioning and rotating the bones of your model and taking snapshots called **keyframes**. You set those keyframes on a **timeline** or **dope sheet** to represent the different positions of your model over time. Playing the animation will interpolate the positions between keyframes. You can also use Blender for this:

## React Three Fiber

In a R3F scene, you can use Drei [useAnimations](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#useanimations), which abstracts Three.js' AnimationMixer to control animations.

```tsx
const MyCharacter = () => {
  const { nodes, materials, animations } = useGLTF(url)
  const { ref, mixer, names, actions, clips } = useAnimations(animations)

  useEffect(() => {
    actions?.jump.play()
  })

  return (
    <mesh ref={ref} {...} />
  )
}
```
