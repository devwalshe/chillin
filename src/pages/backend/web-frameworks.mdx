# üè≠ General-Purpose Web Frameworks

You can build your main backend API using web frameworks or libraries that are not specifically designed for games. But you might need additional processes or services to handle game-specific logic, for instance to run a 3D simulation of a scene for client validation, or a stateful websocket server.

There are plenty of backend languages and frameworks available, such as Rails for Ruby or Django for Python, but I will focus on Node.js options since we are already working with JavaScript or TypeScript.

You may use simple HTTP endpoints, REST, GraphQL, or tRPC.
