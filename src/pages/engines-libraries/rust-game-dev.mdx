# ðŸ¦€ Rust Game Dev

Over the past few years, Rust has taken the low-level programming world by storm thanks to its performance, safety, cross-platform nature, and ease of use. These qualities make Rust a growingly popular choice for game development, and there are many libraries and frameworks that can be used to create games in Rust. It is currently the most loved programming language according to the [StackOverflow 2022 survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#programming-scripting-and-markup-languages).

This website is mainly about JavaScript game development, but due to the growing popularity of Rust for game development and the fact that it can be easily compiled to WebAssembly to run in the browser, I thought it would be useful to summarize what's going on in the Rust ecosystem for those who might be interested.
