# ✏️ Reducing Draw Calls

Draw calls are the number of objects visible in the camera frustum that are rendered to your screen. You want to keep them as low as possible to maintain good performance. Some techniques to keep them low include instancing (1 draw call for n identical meshes instead of n draw calls), or merging meshes together.
