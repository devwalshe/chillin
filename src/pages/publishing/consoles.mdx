# ðŸŽ® Consoles

One of the biggest drawbacks of creating a web-based game, is that browser support on consoles is limited or challenging. So if you intend to publish your game on consoles, you should consider using native engines.

Also, note that to make your game usable on consoles, you'll need to integrate the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API).

## Wrappers

The Xbox One supports HTML / JS games via [UWP apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/development-lanes-html) and [Hosted Web Apps](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/02/17/building-a-great-hosted-web-app/).

It currently doesn't seem possible to publish JavaScript games to PlayStation or Nintendo Switch.

That being said, [Radical Fish Games](https://www.radicalfishgames.com/) was able to release their game [CrossCode](https://www.cross-code.com/en/home) on Switch and PlayStation, by creating their own compiler and transforming JavaScript code to C++. They touch on the process in their blog posts [here](https://www.radicalfishgames.com/?p=6892) and [here](https://www.radicalfishgames.com/?p=6946), and in this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfBzlzvt8RU).

## Browsers

Alternatively, web games can be played in browsers on [Xbox](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/use-microsoft-edge-on-xbox) and [PS4](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/ps4-web-browser/), but [not PS5](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/web-browser-ps5/) or Switch. There are some tricks to access hidden browsers on these as well, but that's not something you'd want your users to go through to play your games).

## Steam Deck

[Steam Decks](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) run the SteamOS Linux distribution. By publishing a [Linux build](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8781#issuecomment-1245964256) of your game to Steam via [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Steamworks.js](https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js), it should work on Steam Deck. You might need the [`--no-sandbox` flag](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/1/4826187053916237100/) when building your Electron game. I haven't done it myself, so please let me know if you have more info or if you can confirm this.
